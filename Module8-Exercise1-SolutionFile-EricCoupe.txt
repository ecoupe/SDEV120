Testing scenario:
program executes
"Geralds Businesses.csv", "Geraldines Businesses.csv" and "DoubleGBusiness.csv" are opened

moves to function readgFile()
this is the first loop so bothAtEnd will still be "N"
the first record is input

moves to function readgdineFile()
this is the first loop so bothAtEnd will still be "N"
the first record is input

moves to function mergeRecords ()
the first records are not equal
the customer number 1598 in geraldines businesses is less than geralds of 4891
this means the record from geraldines businesses will be output to DoubleGBusiness

the next record in geraldines businesses is input
it is 2578 and so also less than geralds so it will be output next to DoubleGBusiness

the next record in geraldines businesses is input
geralds of 4891 is less than 6548 in geraldines so it is output next to DoubleGBusiness

the next record in geralds businesses is input
it is 5148 so less than geraldines so it will be output next to DoubleGBusiness

the next record in geralds businesses is input
geraldines customer number 6548 is less than geralds 8949 so it will be the next output to DoubleGBusiness

the next record in geraldines is input
geralds customer number 8949 is less than geraldines 9853 so it will be the next output to DoubleGBusiness

the next record in geralds is input
gerlds customer number 9841 is less than geraldines 9853 so it will be the next output to DoubleGBusiness

the next record in geralds is attempted
it is eof so variable gcustomerNumber changes to "END_NAME"

the next two records are input then output to DoubleGBusiness

geraldines businesses is now eof so variable dinecustomerNumber is changed to "END_NAME"

both gcustomerNumber AND dinecustomerNumber are "END_NAME" so the variable bothAtEnd changes to "Y"

the program moves to the function finishUp ()
all files are closed

the program ends
