// The two senior class homerooms at Littleville High School
// are having a fundraising drive for the prom. Each time a student
// solicits a contribution, a record is created with the
// student's name and the value. Two files have been created for
// Homeroom A and Homeroom B. Each file is sorted in contribution
// value order from highest to lowest. This program merges the two files.
